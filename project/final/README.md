# Project Topic
- For my project, I'd like my topic to be an artist page for myself as a classical musician and the services I provide. I am choosing this because it is a very practical choice, as it can be helpful for my business endeavors as a musician. I will be using ChatGPT to generate my teaching studio policies, here's a prompt I used: "From the perspective of a private classical voice lesson instructor, write a 500-600 word studio policy." The content will include background information about myself as a musician, information about the services I provide and policies, as well as media related to past engagements.

## Media Queries
### Small screens
- Mainly just changed pages displaying flex or grid below the h1 and nav to block
- Centered nav instead of flexend, as aligning to the right doesnt really read when the width overall is so small; it just ends up looking weirdly misaligned so I moved it center
### Medium
- For medium I added some flex back
### Large/XL
- These were basically the same as I originally had the pages
- h1 font a little bigger
- added all of the grid and flex back in
