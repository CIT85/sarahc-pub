            <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>I am taking this course as an introduction to the fundamentals of coding websites. I have no experience
                with any sort of coding, or actually any branch of computer science at all. I am a private music teacher
                and performer, but I've had an interest in branching out into other industries. I thought this course
                would be a good place to start and see if I'd like to look into computer science.</p>

                    This is the sort of theater one would perform an opera in. Opera is my preferred genre of music.

            <h2>Thoughts on Using ChatGPT to Research a Topic</h2>
            <p>I've never used ChatGPT before this assignment. I was already familiar with what it was, but I had never
                used it myself. I had a lot of fun playing around with it and trying out different topic ideas. In the
                video about writing prompts that was linked in the assignment page, they mentioned the ability of
                chatGPT to pull less-common information or less popular opinions. That was a fun component for me to
                explore. I have played Valorant for a few years, so I feel like I've heard a lot of tips for improving
                in the game over time. It was cool to see chatGPT's less common ideas. After playing with it for a
                while, I can see how intelligent prompt writing can really improve the quality and specificity of the
                output.</p>
